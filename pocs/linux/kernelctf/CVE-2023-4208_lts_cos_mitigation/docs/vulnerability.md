- Introduced by: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=de5df63228fc
- Fixed by: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81
- Affected Version: v3.18-rc1 - v6.5-rc4
- Affected Component: net/sched: cls_u32
- Syscall to disable: disallow unprivileged username space
- URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2023-4208
- Cause: Use-After-Free
- Description: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. When u32_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit 3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81.
